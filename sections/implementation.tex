\section{\sa's Design and Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
\subsection{Design}

% Introduce the design and implementation of the SchemaAnalyst tool; closing with a commentary about the fact that the
% chosen SQL parser is a commercial product that we cannot release on GitHub.

\sa~is implemented in the Java programming language.  Designed with extensibility in mind, the tool is divided into
$13$ packages, which this paper briefly overviews. The \texttt{sqlrepresentation} package provides an intermediate Java
representation of data structures in relational databases, fully modelling database tables, columns, expressions, data
types, integrity constraints, and other relevant entities. These objects enable \sa~to support multiple DBMSs (i.e.,
\sqlite, \postgres, and \hypersql), and, additionally, allow for the inclusion of new DBMSs. The tool also contains the
\texttt{sqlparser} package that wraps the General SQL Parser~\cite{generalsqlparser}, thus enabling the effective
conversion of a schema expressed in the Structured Query Language (SQL) to the tool's intermediate representation. As
this SQL parser is a commercial product, the open-source version of \mbox{\sa}~does not provide it for download.
Therefore, users can experiment with \sa~by either testing the provided schemas or (automatically or manually)
converting a new schema to the tool's internal SQL representation.

% Go into additional details about some of the packages (breaking up an otherwise too-long paragraph)

% GMK NOTE: This paragraph talks about packages in the tool that are not inside of the main technical diagram
% It would be best if there was a statement of why that is the case --- but, I could not easily fit that here

The \texttt{testgeneration} package provides a representation of test suites and test cases, along with test
requirements and the \numcoveragecriteria~coverage criteria~\cite{mcminn2015effectiveness}. The \texttt{data} package
furnishes the \numdatagenerators~test data generators, as well as various generic data-type representations for use
during test data generation~\cite{mcminn2015effectiveness}; Table~\ref{tab:args} summarizes the coverage criteria and
data generators furnished by the the version of \sa~presented in this paper.

% Summarize the final packages in the tool; note that some of these are not part of the diagram

The \texttt{dbms} package provides support for three DBMSs and includes the classes that enable interaction with an
installed DBMS\@. The \texttt{sqlwriter} package furnishes support for creating SQL statements for use with DBMSs and
is used with the \texttt{javawriter} package to encode the generated test data as a JUnit test suite.  The
\texttt{mutation} package provides the mutation analysis functionality, including the mutation
operators~\cite{wright2015mutation}, mutant equivalence and reduction features~\cite{wright2014impact}, and means for
quickly performing mutation analysis~\cite{mcminn2016virtual}.

\subsection{Usage Instructions}

% NOTE: The lstinline command must be on a full line and no line wrapping is allowed (will cause compiler error)

% Explain how the tool is released, downloaded, and built and setup for running

\sa~is publicly available on GitHub under an open-source license~\cite{tool}.
After cloning the Git repository, the project can be built using Gradle by
running the following command in the project's root directory:
\lstinline{./gradlew compile}. After the tool compiles, the user must set the
\lstinline{CLASSPATH} so that it contains \lstinline{build/classes/main},
\lstinline{build/lib/*}, \lstinline{lib/*} and the current working directory.

% command: \lstinline{export CLASSPATH="build/classes/main:build/lib/*:lib/*:."}.

% Talk about installing the databases and then make a reference to the documentation

Optionally, the user can install the \postgres, \sqlite, and \hypersql~DBMSs. Since \sqlite~does not require
configuration on the computer running \sa, it is currently the default option. Using the chosen DBMS, \sa~will run the
generated test suite. If the use of an actual DBMS is desired, the user should refer to online documentation for detailed
instructions~\cite{tool}. The tool also supports a ``virtual'' DBMS executor allowing SQL statements to be simulated.

\input{figures/features}

% Basically, explain the help menu and then the way to generate test data at the command line

Usage instructions for \sa~can be obtained by running \lstinline{java org.schemaanalyst.util.Go --help};
Figure~\ref{fig:usage} shows a snippet of this menu.  As indicated by the help display, \sa~first expects options
indicating the desired schema, coverage criterion, data generator, and DBMS\@. Defaults are provided for all of these
options except for the schema option, which is required. The user must then give a command.  The two supported commands
are \lstinline{generation}, used to generate test data, and \lstinline{mutation}, used to evaluate the quality of test
data.  To run \sa~to generate test data for the provided \texttt{Inventory} schema, the following command could be used:
\lstinline{java org.schemaanalyst.util.Go -s parsedcasestudy.Inventory generation}.

% Discuss the type of output that the tool can produce

With no other command-line options, \sa~will produce a Java class containing a JUnit test suite with the generated test
data. By default, this class will be created under the \texttt{generatedtest} package and saved in a directory of the same
name in the tool's root directory.  The user may append the \lstinline{--inserts} option to the \lstinline{generation}
command to obtain the generated test data in the form of SQL \texttt{INSERT} statements that are saved in plain text
instead of a JUnit test suite.

\input{figures/schemas/schemas}

% Quickly explain the output from performing mutation analysis

If the \lstinline{mutation} command is given to perform mutation analysis on the test data generated by \sa, a directory
called \lstinline{results} will be created in the project's root directory. It will contain a comma-separated value file
recording the parameters used in the analysis as well as the mutation score and some additional runtime information.

% Point the reader to the GitHub site and stress some of the contributions of this paper

The \sa~GitHub page also provides comprehensive documentation, including installation and usage instructions that detail
the inputs, outputs, and behavior of the tool~\cite{tool}. In addition to featuring a thorough JUnit test suite, the
source code of \sa~contains documentation to aid developers who want to extend the tool or to better understand certain
implementation decisions. As an overall contribution of this paper, the presented tool's GitHub repository now includes
over 52,000 lines of Java code and tens of thousands of lines of data files and scripts that enable others to try the
provided examples of schema testing, reproduce the results from our prior experiments, and apply \sa~to new schemas.

% NOTE that this content has been moved to an earlier section of the document

% The help menu provided by the \lstinline{--help} option (Figure~\ref{fig:usage}) shows a complete list of \sa's command
% line arguments with descriptions. Table~\ref{tab:args} shows the coverage criteria and data generators provided with
% \sa.
