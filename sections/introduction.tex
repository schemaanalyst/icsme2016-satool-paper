\section{Introduction}

Much of modern life is driven by data.  Healthcare, science, and commerce rely on information that is
stored in databases~\cite{kapfhammer2007comprehensive}.  When this data is incorrect, passengers can have
their flights delayed, or patients may receive the wrong medication. 
Relational databases allow for relationships between data entries to be expressed, as well as provide structure to 
the data to protect its correctness. The relational database schema is the artifact
that is responsible for safeguarding the integrity of a relational database. The vital role of the database
schema makes testing the schema a task of vital importance.

While non-relational ``NoSQL'' database systems have been gaining in popularity, relational databases remain
pervasive. The widely used video call software Skype uses the PostgreSQL database management system
(DBMS)~\cite{https://www.postgresql.org/about/users/},
and Google makes use of SQLite in Android phones~\cite{https://www.sqlite.org/famous.html}.
Additionally, according to DB-Engines.com, the top three most popular DBMSs are 
relational~\cite{http://db-engines.com/en/ranking}, and the 968,277 questions posted on StackExchange 
about relational databases show the demand for their support~\cite{http://goo.gl/F3Tiax}.

\textit{SchemaAnalyst} is a tool for generating high-quality test data in support of database schema
testing. Using a search-based approach that evaluates fitness to incrementally improve test data~\cite{Korel:AVM},
\textit{SchemaAnalyst} discovers test data instances that comprehensively exercise the database schema.
\textit{SchemaAnalyst} includes an evaluation framework
with a collection of real-world case study schemas, as well as a mutation analysis feature
that enables verifying the quality of the generated test data based on its ability to detect artificially
seeded faults. Additionally, \textit{SchemaAnalyst}
is extensible, well documented, and available on GitHub with an open-source license~\cite{tool}.

\textit{SchemaAnalyst} has been used extensively to support research studies involving search-based
software testing~\cite{kapfhammer2013search,mcminn2015effectiveness,kinneer2015automatically}, and
mutation testing~\cite{wright2013efficient,wright2014impact,wright2015mutation}.

In summary, the key contributions of this work are as follows:
