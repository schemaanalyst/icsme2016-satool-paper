\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Healthcare, science, and commerce often rely on information that is stored in
databases~\cite{kapfhammer2007comprehensive}.  When this data is incorrect, passengers can have their flights delayed or
patients may receive the wrong medication~\cite{databasebook}.  In addition to documenting the structure of and
connections between data entries, relational databases furnish a means for protecting the correctness of the data that
they store.  In particular, the relational database schema is the artifact that is responsible for safeguarding the
integrity of a relational database. The vital role of the database schema makes testing the schema a task of vital
importance.

While non-relational ``NoSQL'' database systems have been gaining in popularity, relational databases remain pervasive.
The widely used video call software Skype uses the PostgreSQL database management system (DBMS)~\cite{postgres}, and
Google makes use of SQLite in Android phones~\cite{sqlite}.  Additionally, according to DB-Engines.com, the top three
most popular DBMSs are relational~\cite{dbrank}, and the 968,277 questions posted on StackExchange about relational
databases show the demand for their support~\cite{stackexchange}.

\textit{SchemaAnalyst} is a tool for generating high-quality test data in support of database schema testing. Using a
search-based approach that evaluates fitness to incrementally improve test data~\cite{Korel:AVM}, \textit{SchemaAnalyst}
discovers test data instances that comprehensively exercise the database schema.  \textit{SchemaAnalyst} includes an
evaluation framework with a collection of real-world case study schemas, as well as a mutation analysis feature that
enables verifying the quality of the generated test data based on its ability to detect artificially seeded faults.
Additionally, \textit{SchemaAnalyst} is extensible, well documented, and available on GitHub under an open-source
license~\cite{tool}.

\textit{SchemaAnalyst} has been used to support research studies involving search-based software
testing~\cite{kapfhammer2013search,mcminn2015effectiveness,kinneer2015automatically}, and mutation
testing~\cite{wright2013efficient,wright2014impact,wright2015mutation,mcminn2016virtual}.

In summary, the key contributions of this paper are as follows:
