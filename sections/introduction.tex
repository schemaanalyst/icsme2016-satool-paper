\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Much of modern life is driven by data.  Healthcare, science, and commerce rely on information that is stored in
databases~\cite{kapfhammer2007comprehensive}.  When this data is incorrect, passengers can have their flights delayed,
or patients may receive the wrong medication.  Relational databases allow for relationships between data entries to be
expressed, as well as provide structure to the data to protect its correctness. The relational database schema is the
artifact that is responsible for safeguarding the integrity of a relational database. The vital role of the database
schema makes testing the schema a task of vital importance.

While non-relational ``NoSQL'' database systems have been gaining in popularity, relational databases remain pervasive.
The widely used video call software Skype uses the PostgreSQL database management system (DBMS)~\cite{postgres}, and
Google makes use of SQLite in Android phones~\cite{sqlite}.  Additionally, according to DB-Engines.com, the top three
most popular DBMSs are relational~\cite{dbrank}, and the 968,277 questions posted on StackExchange about relational
databases show the demand for their support~\cite{stackexchange}.

\textit{SchemaAnalyst} is a tool for generating high-quality test data in support of database schema testing. Using a
search-based approach that evaluates fitness to incrementally improve test data~\cite{Korel:AVM}, \textit{SchemaAnalyst}
discovers test data instances that comprehensively exercise the database schema.  \textit{SchemaAnalyst} includes an
evaluation framework with a collection of real-world case study schemas, as well as a mutation analysis feature that
enables verifying the quality of the generated test data based on its ability to detect artificially seeded faults.
Additionally, \textit{SchemaAnalyst} is extensible, well documented, and available on GitHub under an open-source
license~\cite{tool}.

\textit{SchemaAnalyst} has been used to support research studies involving search-based software
testing~\cite{kapfhammer2013search,mcminn2015effectiveness,kinneer2015automatically}, and mutation
testing~\cite{wright2013efficient,wright2014impact,wright2015mutation,mcminn2016virtual}.

In summary, the key contributions of this paper are as follows:
