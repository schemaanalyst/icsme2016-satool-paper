Data stored in relational databases plays a vital role in many aspects of society.  When this data in incorrect, the
services that depend on it may be compromised.  The database schema is the artefact responsible for maintaining the
integrity of stored data. Because of its critical function, the proper testing of the database schema is a task of
critical importance. Employing a search-based approach to generate high-quality test data for database schemas, \sa~is a
tool that supports testing this critical software component. \sa~is extensible and includes both a comprehensive
evaluation framework for assessing the quality of test data and full-featured documentation. In addition to describing
the implementation of \sa~and overviewing its efficiency and effectiveness, this paper coincides with the public release
of \sa~as a tool that can enhance practitioners' ability to test relational database schemas.
