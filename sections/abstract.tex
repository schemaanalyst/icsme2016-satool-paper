\begin{abstract}

Data stored in relational databases plays a vital role in many aspects of society. When this data is incorrect, the
services that depend on it may be compromised. The database schema is the artefact responsible for maintaining the
integrity of stored data. Because of its critical function, the proper testing of the database schema is a task of great
importance. Employing a search-based approach to generate high-quality test data for database schemas, \sa~is a tool
that supports testing this key software component. The presented tool is extensible and includes both an evaluation
framework for assessing the quality of the generated tests and full-featured documentation. In addition to describing
the design and implementation of \sa~and overviewing its efficiency and effectiveness, this paper coincides with the
the tool's public release, thereby enhancing practitioners' ability to test relational database schemas.
