\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

Many data-centric services rely on the quality of the underlying data. Much of this data is managed by relational
databases, and the database schema protects the integrity of the data.  Testing the schema for correctness is vital to
ensuring data quality. \sa~is a tool for generating test data for relational database schemas to ensure that the schema
is functioning as intended. Using a search-based technique, \sa~is able to provide high quality test data across
multiple database management systems. \sa~also includes an evaluation framework, including 94 case-study schemas and
mutation analysis support. \sa~has been used in five published studies. \sa~is available to the public on
GitHub~\cite{tool}. With an open-source license and modular design, \sa~is an extensible platform for search-based test
data generation and mutation testing.
