\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

Many data-centric services rely on the quality of the underlying data. Much of this data is managed by relational
databases, and the database schema protects the integrity of the data.  Testing the schema for correctness is vital to
ensuring data quality. \sa~is a tool for generating test data for relational database schemas to ensure that the schema
is functioning as intended. Using a search-based technique, \sa~is able to provide high quality test data across
multiple database management systems. \sa~also includes an evaluation framework, including
\numprovidedschemas~case-study schemas and mutation analysis support. \sa~has been used in \numuniquepapers published
studies.  \sa~is available to the public on GitHub~\cite{tool}. With an open-source license and modular design, \sa~is
an extensible platform for search-based test data generation and mutation testing.
