\section{Conclusion}

Many data-centric services rely on the quality of the underlying data. Much of this data
is managed by relational databases, and the database schema protects the integrity of the data.
Testing the schema for correctness is vital to ensuring data quality. \textit{SchemaAnalyst} is a
tool for generating test data for relational database schemas to ensure that the schema is functioning 
as intended. Using a search-based technique, \textit{SchemaAnalyst} is able to provide high quality test
data across multiple database management systems. \textit{SchemaAnalyst} also includes an evaluation
framework, including 94 case-study schemas and mutation analysis support. \textit{SchemaAnalyst} has been
used in five published studies.
\textit{SchemaAnalyst} is available to the public on
GitHub~\cite{tool}. With an open-source license and modular design, \textit{SchemaAnalyst} is an extensible
platform for search-based test data generation and mutation testing.
