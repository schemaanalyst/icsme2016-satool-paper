\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

Many data-centric services rely on the quality of the underlying data. Much of this data is managed by relational
databases, and the database schema protects the integrity of the data.  Testing the schema for correctness is vital to
ensuring data quality. \sa~is a tool that generates test data for a relational database schema, thereby increasing
confidence in the schema's correctness. Using a search-based technique, \sa~is able to provide high-quality test data
across multiple DBMSs. \sa~also includes an evaluation framework that provides \numprovidedschemas~case-study schemas
and support for efficient mutation analysis. In addition to being used in \numuniquepapers~published studies, the
presented tool is now available to the public on GitHub~\cite{tool}. With an open-source license and a modular design,
\sa~is an extensible tool for search-based test data generation and mutation testing, enabling the work of researchers
and practitioners.

In future work, we plan to evaluate how \sa~helps the people who design and test relational database schemas. We will
also integrate the tool with others that support software maintenance activities like regression
testing~\cite{Kapfhammer2008} and fault localization~\cite{Clark2011}. Next, we will further extend \sa~so that it
enables the testing of recent NoSQL systems. Ultimately, the current version of \sa, our planned extensions, and the
features and studies contributed by new users of this open-source tool will yield a comprehensive approach to testing
data-centric applications.
