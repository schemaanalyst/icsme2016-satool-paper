\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

Many data-centric services rely on the quality of the underlying data. Much of this data is managed by relational
databases, and the database schema protects the integrity of the data.  Testing the schema for correctness is vital to
ensuring data quality. \sa~is a tool that generates test data for a relational database schema, thereby increasing
confidence in the schema's correctness. Using a search-based technique, \sa~is able to provide high-quality test data
across multiple DBMSs. \sa~also includes an evaluation framework that provides \numprovidedschemas~case-study schemas
and support for efficient mutation analysis. In addition to being used in \numuniquepapers~published studies, the
presented tool is now available to the public on GitHub~\cite{tool}. With an open-source license and a modular design,
\sa~is an extensible tool for search-based test data generation and mutation testing, enabling the work of researchers
and practitioners.
