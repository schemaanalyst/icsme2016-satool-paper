\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

Many data-centric services rely on the quality of the underlying data. Much of this data is managed by relational
databases, and the database schema protects the integrity of the data.  Testing the schema for correctness is vital to
ensuring data quality. \sa~is a tool for generating test data for relational database schemas to ensure that the schema
is functioning as intended. Using a search-based technique, \sa~is able to provide high quality test data across
multiple database management systems. \sa~also includes an evaluation framework that provides
\numprovidedschemas~case-study schemas and support for efficient mutation analysis. In addition to being used in
\numuniquepapers~published studies, the presented tool is now available to the public on GitHub~\cite{tool}. With an
open-source license and modular design, \sa~is an extensible platform for search-based test data generation and mutation
testing.
