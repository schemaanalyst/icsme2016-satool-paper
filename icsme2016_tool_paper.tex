\begin{abstract}

Data stored in relational databases plays a vital role in many aspects of life.  When this data in incorrect, the
services that depend on that data may be compromised.  The database schema is the artefact responsible for maintaining
the integrity of stored data. Because of its critical function, the proper testing of the database schema is a task of
critical importance. \sa~is a tool to support testing this vital software component that uses a search-based approach to
generate high-quality test data for database schemas. \sa~is extensible and includes both a comprehensive evaluation
framework for evaluating the quality of test data and comprehensive documentation. In addition to describing the
implementation of \sa~and overviewing the past study of its efficiency and effectiveness, this paper
corresponds to the public release of \sa~as a means to enhance practitioners' ability to test database schemas.
