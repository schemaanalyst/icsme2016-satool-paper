# icsme2016-satool-paper

This repository contains the LaTeX source code and additional resources for a
research paper that was accepted for publication at the [32nd International
Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution](http://icsme2016.github.io/)
(ICSME 2016). The source code of the paper uses the LaTeX style files provided
by the organizers of the workshop and a wide variety of other packages that are
normally standard with a modern LaTeX distribution such a TeXLive 2015.

You are invited to use this repository as a means for learning more about
preparing papers in the field of automated software testing and as a way to
investigate the results and writing in our paper. If you find this repository
useful, could we trouble you to star this repository and then acknowledge it in
your own research efforts? If you would like to learn more about research in
